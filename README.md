# CompoundDb.Hsapiens.HMDB.5.0


This package was developed by using [CompoundDb] (https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/CompoundDb) to use with 
[MetaboAnnotation] (https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MetaboAnnotation) to carry out compound annotation  based on [HMDB] 
(http://www.hmdb.ca) version 5.

The metabolite structure file (in SDF format) structures.zip and hmdb_experimental_msms_spectra.zip were used to develop the package 
by using the functions of the package [CompoundDb] (https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/CompoundDb).

Data from HMDB was downloaded on: 20/June/2022.
